### Find a project to contribute to 

A note from a good [article](https://dev.to/isabelcmdcosta/how-to-find-open-source-projects-to-contribute-2o1e) from `Dev.to`.

### Where to find a project to contribute to 

* The open source API/App/Framework you are **currently working with**

* **Aggregator**
  
  There are websites aggregate open source projects or issues to make the process of finding projects to contribute easier. 
  
  * [Up For Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/)
  * [Code triage](https://www.codetriage.com/)
  * [Ovio](https://ovio.org/projects)
  * [Contrib](https://gauger.io/contrib/#/language/cpp)
  
* **Open Source initiatives** [-](https://isabelcosta.github.io/posts/open-source-initiatives/)

  Programs focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. 

  These events take place and last for a months every year. Some are targeting university students or younger youth.

  * [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)
  * [24 Pull Requests](https://24pullrequests.com/)
  * [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

* **GitHub Explore**

  It suggests you projects based on your interest. Besides, there are **Topics**, **Trending**, **Collections** and **Events** to browse. 

  Take a look at hat ï¼©'ve found [pycom](https://github.com/Omyyyy/pycom). A very interesting project but not quite useful yet. 

```
Remember to find a "good first issue" or "beginner tag".
```
```
Make sure to read the contribution guildline.

### What to contribute

As a beginner, without proper experience, you generally have no idea what and how to contribute to the code base. Especially when the code base is extremely large and the domain is what you might not have deep insight to. But don't panic, 

    Reporting useful issues is already an open source contribution.

As you keep digging into the project, I believe the more you can contribute. All you have to do is  to get started.
